# Virtual piano online
A free virtual piano that you can find on this website is a wonderful opportunity for you to try your compositional skills. You can play it on your computer keyboard, or using your mouse. Each keyboard button corresponds to one key on the piano and plays the respective sound. Sounds are the samples of the highest quality recorded with a real live piano.
